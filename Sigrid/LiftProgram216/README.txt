In main
 - SATSELIXIA must have a pre-downloaded file due to the system Sats use on their website.
 - ACTIC can read both. Passing true to its constructor implies it is a file, false for a weblink.

By running Main the pages are lifted and the program generates a structured file of resources,
properties and Literals. It is all written to one file and creates our 'database' for the project.
The file is calles FindMyFitness.ttl.

The program uses JSOUP to lift the data.
